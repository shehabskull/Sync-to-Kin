Although compliance is important, what constitutes compliance is sometimes open to interpretation. The rule of thumb, though, is this: for each 10 percent closer you get to perfect compliance, your response rates drop by 10 percent. The plain and simple truth is that overly zealous compliance in many cases results in weaker copy.

المعنى الحقيقي لـ «تطوير الذات»: وضع القيم الأفضل في موضع الأولوية، واختيار أشياء أفضل لكي تمنحها اهتمامك. هذا لأن مشاكلك تكون أفضل عندما تركز انتباهك على أشياء أفضل. وعندما تصير مشاكلك أفضل، فإن حياتك تصير أفضل أيضًا . ينصبّ اهتمام ما بقي من هذا الكتاب على خمس قيم تخالف الحدس المعتاد والمألوف، لكني أظنها أكثر القيم التي يمكن للمرء أن يتبناها فائدة. تتبع هذه القيم كلها «القانون التراجعي» الذي تحدثنا عنه في وقت سابق، وذلك من حيث إنها قيَم «سلبية». تتطلب هذه القيم كلها مواجهة مشكلات أكثر عمقًا بدلًا من تجنب تلك المشكلات من خلال المخارج السريعة السهلة. وهذه القيم الخمس غير تقليدية وغير مريحة في الوقت نفسه. لكني أراها قيَمًا قادرة على تغيير حياة المرء . القيمة الأولى التي سنلقي نظرة عليها في الفصل التالي هي شكل متشدد من أشكال المسؤولية: تحمّل المسؤولية عن كل شيء يحدث في حياتك بصرف النظر عمّن هو ملومٌ فيه. القيمة الثانية هي اللايقين: إقرارك بجهلك وممارستك الشك الدائم في آرائك ومعتقداتك. وأما القيمة الثالثة فهي الفشل، أو الإخفاق: استعدادك لاكتشاف أخطائك ونقاط ضعفك حتى تكون قادرًا على العمل عليها لتحسينها. والرابعة هي الرفض: القدرة على أن تقول كلمة لا، وعلى أن تسمعها أيضًا؛ وهذا ما يحدد ما تقبله في حياتك وما لا تقبله تحديدًا واضحًا تمامًا. ثم تأتي القيمة الأخيرة التي هي تأمّلك في حقيقة أنك لست خالدًا. هذه قيمة حاسمة الأهمية لأن بقاء المرء منتبهًا إلى أنه سيموت قد يكون الأمر الوحيد القادر على مساعدتنا في النظر إلى قيَمنا الأخرى كلها نظرة صحيحة . الفصل الخامس: أنت في حالة اختيار دائم تخيل أن أحدًا يصوّب سلاحًا إلى رأسك ويقول لك إن عليك أن تجري اثنين وأربعين كيلومترًا في أقل من خمس ساعات وإلا فسوف يقتلك ويقتل أسرتك كلها معك .
